# About Sarah

## Background

Sarah grew up reading, writing, and watching all the movies she could get her hands on. As the middle child of five, she spent years working at her parents' bed and breakfast, where she met countless fascinating guests and made an equal number of beds.

It was actually one of those guests who first suggested technical writing to Sarah when she was in high school and connected her with an internship at IBM—and the rest is history. A Boston native, Sarah is a New Englander at heart and is grateful for how it shaped her.

## Today

Sarah currently lives in Minneapolis and embraces the academic nomad lifestyle. Her husband is a professor, and they've lived in four different states since 2020. Thanks to his work as a cognitive scientist, she's learned more about embodied cognition and the brain than she ever cared to.


## Interests

When she's not working, you'll find her puttering, thrifting, crafting, and daydreaming story ideas.
